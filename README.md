### VIVA Hand Detection Challenge Using A Keras RetinaNet

In this project, [RetinaNet](https://research.fb.com/publications/focal-loss-for-dense-object-detection/), a one-stage object detection system developed by Lin et al is used for the [VIVA Hand Detection Challenge](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/vivachallenge/index.php/hands/hand-detection/).

The model training piggy backs off the [`keras-retinanet`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) implementation.

You'll also need Octave and [Piotr's Computer Vision Matlab Toolbox](https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/) for evaluation.
